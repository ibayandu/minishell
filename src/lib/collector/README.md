# Collector

This is basic c implementation of a garbage collector logic.

Before usage checkout the examples folder and make sure u read all the comments. After that u can simply run "make" in current directory. The "collector.h" interface will be available inside "incs" folder. Also the "collector.a" static library will be inside "build/libs" folder.
